# Pan360 Configuration File
# Configuration for 360° Panoramic Camera System

# Stepper Motor Configuration
motor:
  # GPIO pins for ULN2003 driver (BCM numbering)
  # Connect IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 to these GPIO pins
  gpio_pins: [17, 18, 27, 22]
  
  # Delay between steps (seconds) - lower = faster, but may skip steps
  step_delay: 0.001
  
  # Steps per full 360° rotation (4096 for 28BYJ-48 with gear reduction)
  steps_per_revolution: 4096

# Camera Configuration
camera:
  # Image resolution (width, height)
  # Pi Camera V2 max: 3280 x 2464
  # Pi Camera V3 max: 4608 x 2592
  # HQ Camera max: 4056 x 3040
  resolution: [3280, 2464]
  
  # Output directory for captured images
  output_dir: "images"
  
  # Stabilization delay after camera initialization (seconds)
  # Increase if images are still dark or inconsistent
  stabilization_delay: 2.0
  
  # Manual exposure settings (optional - camera will auto-meter first)
  # Leave commented to use auto-metered values
  exposure:
    # Exposure time in microseconds (typical range: 10000-50000)
    # Uncomment to override auto-metered exposure
    # time: 30000
    # Analogue gain (typical range: 1.0-8.0)
    # Uncomment to override auto-metered gain
    # gain: 2.0
  
  # White balance settings
  white_balance:
    red_gain: 1.5
    blue_gain: 1.5

# Scanning Configuration
scan:
  # Angle increment between captures (degrees)
  # Smaller angle = more overlap = better stitching, but more images
  # Recommended: 10-20 degrees
  angle_increment: 25.0
  
  # Total rotation angle (360 for full panorama)
  total_angle: 360.0
  
  # Settle time after motor movement before capture (seconds)
  # Allows vibrations to dampen for sharp images
  settle_time: 0.8
  
  # Direction of rotation (true = clockwise, false = counter-clockwise)
  clockwise: true
  
  # Return to home position after scan
  return_home: true

# Advanced Settings
advanced:
  # Enable verbose logging
  verbose: true
  
  # Create session subdirectories for each scan
  use_session_dirs: true
  
  # Image format (jpg, png)
  image_format: "jpg"
  
  # JPEG quality (1-100, only for jpg format)
  jpeg_quality: 95
